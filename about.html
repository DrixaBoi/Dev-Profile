                            I was born in Salt Lake City, Ut. That is where I lived most of my life, and enjoy getting to visit the friends and family I grew up with there when we visit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have always been a creative person, in the many different forms there is to express oneself creatively. I have many sketches, paintings, and even apprenticed as a tattoo artist, and paint models in my free time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My initial career plan was in the culinary field. Starting as a dishwasher I eventually worked my way up to a Sous Chef. I managed, and helped manage several kitchens in upscale retirement communities throughout Utah, and now even in Florida. Being a Chef has its ups and downs as any career, but after nearly 12 years in the field I just felt perhaps it wasn't what I wanted to do the rest of my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the age of 25 I was diagnosed with end stage renal failure, and was told I would need a kidney transplant. After a few years of this new life change it began getting harder to complete 8 to 12 hour work days in a hot physically demanding kitchen, especially days I had dialysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a few hard years I met the love of my life. She lived in Florida, I am still in Utah, but we knew we were meant to be together. A few years of talking online, and taking trips back and forth, we agreed it would be best for my daughter and I to move to Florida to start being a family.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just over a year of living here I was approved for my kidney transplant at the Mayo Clinic Hospital. I received my transplant, and haven't had any complications since. My health improved almost instantly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So with all the new positive life changes, we decided it would be a great time for me to pursue another career I had always considered. Enrolling in a Full Stack Developer course was the first step, and I am excited to embark on this adventure and what the future may hold.
