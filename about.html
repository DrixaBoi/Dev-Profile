                            I was born in Salt Lake City, Ut. and lived there until I was 31 years old. Utah is also where I had my daughter
                            who has been with me since the moment she was born. After some of lifes usual ups and downs I eventually
                            entered into the culinary world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have always been a creative person, from drawing to painting, building models or whatever sparks of
                            inspiration somehow found their way into my interest. I apprenticed as a tattoo artist briefly, before
                            shifting to a more personally fulfilling hobby of painting Warhammer models and armies. Painted some commission
                            work for clients and friends, but nowhere near a sustainable source of income.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beginning as a dishwasher and eventually, after a few years of watching
                            listening and learning, had the opportunity of becoming a line cook. From there I went upwards to a Sous
                            Chef, incharge of two large kitchens on the weekends while the Chef handled the weekdays. Better paying
                            offers were taken over time and things went upward for the next 12 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the age of 25 I was diagnosed with end stage renal failure, and was told I would need to be on
                            dialysis until I was able to get a kidney transplant. After a few years of managing this new life change
                            it grew increasingly difficult to work 8 to 12 hour days inbetween days I had dialysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a few hard years I met the love of my life. She lived in Florida and we kne early on we were quite the pair. A few years of talking online,
                            and taking trips back and forth, we agreed it would be best for my daughter and I to move to Florida permanently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just over a year of living here I was approved for my kidney transplant at the Mayo Clinic Hospital. What a
                            difference that made in my day to day energy and health! Everything was looking on the up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So with these positive new changes and the fortunate situation my new family found ourselves in we agreed a
                            change in career was not out of the question. So here I am now bettering myself and increasing my own knowledge
                            of web design with the support of my wonderful Fiance, and daughter to help me through. I am excited to embark on
                            this adventure and what the future may hold.
